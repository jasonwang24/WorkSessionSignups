# WorkSessionSignups

This is a full stack web application I created to allow team leads of our Waterloop design team to be able to manage and facilitate
work sessions in a more effective way. This application was developed to support postings and signups for various work sessions, displaying
a clear and elegant UI. I leveraged various technologies including GraphQL, React and a MongoDB server.
